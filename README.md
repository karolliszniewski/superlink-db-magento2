Certainly. Let's focus on removing the superlink directly from the Magento 2 database. This approach can be useful in certain situations, but it's important to understand the implications and why it might be chosen over other methods.
First, let's visualize the relevant database tables for superlinks:

To remove the superlink directly in the database, you would need to execute SQL queries to delete the relevant records. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
-- Step 1: Identify the configurable product's entity_id
SET @configurable_product_id = (SELECT entity_id FROM catalog_product_entity WHERE sku = 'your_configurable_product_sku');

-- Step 2: Remove entries from catalog_product_super_link
DELETE FROM catalog_product_super_link
WHERE parent_id = @configurable_product_id;

-- Step 3: Remove entries from catalog_product_super_attribute_label
DELETE csal FROM catalog_product_super_attribute_label csal
INNER JOIN catalog_product_super_attribute cpsa ON csal.product_super_attribute_id = cpsa.product_super_attribute_id
WHERE cpsa.product_id = @configurable_product_id;

-- Step 4: Remove entries from catalog_product_super_attribute
DELETE FROM catalog_product_super_attribute
WHERE product_id = @configurable_product_id;
```

Explanation of this approach:

We first identify the configurable product's entity_id using its SKU.
We remove all entries from catalog_product_super_link that link simple products to this configurable product.
We remove all attribute labels associated with this configurable product from catalog_product_super_attribute_label.
Finally, we remove all super attribute entries for this configurable product from catalog_product_super_attribute.

Why this way and not different:

Direct Database Manipulation:

Pros:

It's faster than using Magento's ORM or API.
It can be useful for bulk operations or when dealing with data inconsistencies.


Cons:

Bypasses Magento's built-in logic and events.
Can lead to data integrity issues if not done carefully.




Using Magento's ORM or API (as in the previous PHP example):

Pros:

Follows Magento's best practices.
Triggers relevant events and observers.
Maintains data integrity and consistency.


Cons:

Can be slower, especially for bulk operations.
May not be sufficient for fixing certain types of data corruption.





The database approach is generally recommended only in specific scenarios:

Data cleanup or correction of large datasets.
When dealing with corrupted data that can't be fixed through the standard API.
During development or testing phases where quick changes are needed.

However, it's crucial to note that directly manipulating the database:

Can lead to indexing issues.
Might not update related caches.
Could cause inconsistencies with other related data.

After performing direct database operations, you should:

Reindex affected indexes.
Clear relevant caches.
Verify the changes didn't cause unintended side effects.

In a production environment, it's generally safer to use Magento's built-in methods unless you have a specific reason to directly manipulate the database. Always ensure you have a backup before performing such operations.
